# FizzBuzz_Job-interview-question
This repository contains Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, substituting "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
## FizzBuzz Game
The FizzBuzz game is a classic programming exercise designed to teach the use of loops, conditionals, and basic logic. The rules of the game are straightforward:
## Rules
Print Numbers: The program should print each number from 1 to 100, inclusive.
Divisibility by 3: For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
Divisibility by 5: For numbers divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
Divisibility by Both 3 and 5: For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 (such as 15), print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
## How It Works
Loop Through Numbers: The program uses a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100.
Check Divisibility:
For each number, the program checks if it is divisible by 3, 5, or both.
If divisible by 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".
If divisible by only 3, it prints "Fizz".
If divisible by only 5, it prints "Buzz".
If not divisible by either, it prints the number itself.
